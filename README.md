Project Title: "Mc Cueva Interactive Portfolio Website".

Description:

This project is a personal, interactive portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases of my background, skills, education, and experiences in a clean and structured layout.

Interactions and Features:

1. Sticky Navigation Bar
   The navigation bar stays fixed at the top of the screen as users scroll (position: sticky), providing quick access to all sections of the page without losing orientation.

2. Smooth Scrolling Navigation
   Clicking any navigation link scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section (scroll-behavior: smooth), offering a seamless user experience.

3. Hover Effects on Navigation Links
   Navigation links change color when hovered over, providing visual feedback that enhances interactivity (`nav a:hover` with `transition: color 0.3s`).

4. Section Highlight on Hover
   Each sectionâ€™s background color subtly changes when the user hovers over it (section:hover), improving engagement and focus while browsing.

5. Responsive Scroll-to-Top Button.


Additional Visual and Structural Highlights:

1. Profile Image Presentation
  The homepage displays a professional profile picture styled with borders and rounded corners to create a polished look.

2. Responsive Layout with Flexbox
  The home section uses `flexbox` for adaptive arrangement of text and image content on various screen sizes.

3. Alternating Section Backgrounds
  Using `section:nth-child(even)`, the design subtly alternates background colors to distinguish content sections.

4. Footer with Copyright
  A simple footer at the bottom of the page reinforces ownership and finality to the layout.
